# caloric-intake-calculator
This calculator can be used to determine the following:
- What your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is. This is the caloric intake that your body needs every day in order to properly execute basic operations.
- What your TDEE (Total Daily Energey Expenditure) is. This value is based off your BMR and your weekly activity level. Your TDEE is the approximate amount of calories
  which you burn on a daily basis.
- What your suggested daily caloric intake is. This value is based off your TDEE and your given weight goal. It will change depending on whether you want to gain,
  lose or maintain your current weight.
  
# Usage
Follow the instructions the script gives you when you run it. It should be self-explanatory.
